- Domain:
    The domain in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) refers to the main area of interest or problem space that your software is addressing.
    It encompasses all the business logic, rules, and processes related to that problem space.
    In our project, the main focus is on handling invoices and the factoring process. Therefore, the domain is Invoicing and Factoring.

- Invoicing
  Invoicing involves creating and managing invoices, which are documents issued by a seller to a buyer. Invoices typically include details such as:

    1- The buyer and seller information.
    2- The products or services sold.
    3- The quantities and costs.
    4- The total amount due.
    5- Payment terms and due date.

- Factoring
 Factoring is a financial transaction where a company (the seller or creditor) sells its accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party
 (the factoring company, e.g., Billie).
 The factoring company then takes on the responsibility of collecting the money from the buyer (the debtor).

 Here's a more detailed breakdown of the factoring process:Invoice Creation:

    - The seller issues an invoice to the buyer for goods or services provided.
    - Invoice Sale: The seller sells the invoice to the factoring company. The factoring company buys the invoice, and providing the seller with immediate cash flow.
    - Collection: The factoring company collects the payment from the buyer when the invoice is due.
    - Risk Management: Since there is always a risk that a debtor might not pay their invoices, the factoring company (Billie) manages this risk
      by setting a debtor limit for each company. This limit is the maximum total amount of open invoices a debtor can have.
      If the debtor's total amount of open invoices reaches this limit, Billie won't accept any more invoices from that debtor.

- Subdomains
    Subdomains break down the domain into smaller, more manageable areas. For the Invoicing and Factoring domain, we can identify the following subdomains:

    Company Management: Handles the addition and management of companies.
    Invoice Management: Deals with creating, managing, and marking invoices as paid.
    Factoring Management: Manages the process of selling invoices to the factoring company (Billie) and checking debtor limits.

- Bounded Contexts
  Bounded contexts define clear boundaries within a domain where a particular model is defined and applicable. Each subdomain identified above can be considered a bounded context.

  1- Company Management Context: Manages all company-related information and operations.
  2- Invoice Management Context: Handles all operations related to invoices.
  3- Factoring Management Context: Manages the factoring process and debtor limits.
